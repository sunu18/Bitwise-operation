# Bitwise-operation

In C programming language, bitwise operations are used to manipulate individual bits of data in a variable. There are six different bitwise operators available in C:

Bitwise AND (&): performs a bitwise AND operation between the bits of two integers and returns the result.

Bitwise OR (|): performs a bitwise OR operation between the bits of two integers and returns the result.

Bitwise XOR (^): performs a bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) operation between the bits of two integers and returns the result.

Bitwise NOT (~): performs a bitwise complement (NOT) operation on a single integer and returns the result.

Left shift (<<): shifts the bits of the left operand to the left by a number of positions specified by the right operand and returns the result.

Right shift (>>): shifts the bits of the left operand to the right by a number of positions specified by the right operand and returns the result.

An example code snippet using these bitwise operators is as follows:

This example uses the bitwise operators to perform different operations on two integer variables a and b, such as bitwise AND, OR, XOR, NOT, left shift, and right shift. The results of these operations are then printed using printf statements.
